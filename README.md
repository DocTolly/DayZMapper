<b>How to install:</b>

<pre>
1. Copy bin/* to your webhost (Can be the server that DayZ is running on but you
will need either apache or some other http server that can handle php)
2. Rename example_config.php to config.php
3. Change config.php to have your username/password/hostname etc.
4. Rename either map_chernarus_example.txt or map_chernarus_lingor.txt to map.txt
5. Point your browser to wherever you copied stuff to.
</pre>

<b>Optional:</b>

Create .htaccess file to password protect the website.

If you want to use your own map graphic you need to specify certain values in the map.txt

First line map.txt is the file that is loaded. The second is how wide the image is. 3rd is how tall the image is. 4th is X offset. 5th is Y offset. 6th is the map X scale. 7th is the map Y scale.

If you have any questions ask zamp @ freenode/ircnet/quakenet/whatever just whois me.
