How to install:

1. Copy bin/* to your webhost (Can be the server that DayZ is running on but you will need either apache or some other http server that can handle php)

2. Rename example_config.php to config.php

3. Change config.php to have your username/password/hostname etc.

4. Rename either map_chernarus_example.txt or map_chernarus_lingor.txt to map.txt

5. Point your browser to wherever you copied stuff to.

Optional:

Create .htaccess file to password protect the website.

To use your own map graphic:

1st line in map.txt is the file that is loaded.

2nd line is how wide the image is.

3rd line is how tall the image is.

4th line is X offset

5th line is Y offset

6th line is the map X scale

7th line is the map Y scale
