How to install:
<b>Only works with Lingor for now!</b>

Copy bin/* to your webhost (Can be the server that DayZ is running on but you will need either apache or some other http server that can handle php)
Change data.php to have your username/password/hostname etc.
Point your browser to wherever you copied stuff to.

Optionally
Create .htaccess file to password protect the website.

If you have any questions ask zamp @ freenode/ircnet/quakenet/whatever just whois me.
